    <p>In tribute to generations of researchers and acupuncturists who roamed the ways of Sky and Earth in an attempt
       to understand the movements of Qi.
       May this tool be helpful to the generations to come on their own path!
    </p>

    <p>This project is based on the works of the following therapists and researchers in acupuncture:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Charles Laville-Méry, who invented the Ganzhi wheel,</li>
        <li>Thierry Bollet, who invented the Ganzhi and energies of the year wheel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Their researches come from the careful reading of the ancient Chinese medical text, <em>Huangdi Nei Jing Suwen</em>
       (黄帝内经素問), known as the <em>Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor</em>.
    </p>
